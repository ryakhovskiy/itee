#The JDBC spec is unforgivably silent on what should happen to unresolved,
#pending transactions on Connection close.
#C3P0's default policy is to rollback any uncommitted, pending work.
#Setting autoCommitOnClose to true causes uncommitted pending work to be committed,
#rather than rolled back on Connection close. [Note: Since the spec is absurdly unclear on this question,
#application authors who wish to avoid bugs and inconsistent behavior should ensure that all transactions
#are explicitly either committed or rolled-back before close is called.]

#If provided, c3p0 will create an empty table of the specified name,

#If automaticTestTable is provided, c3p0 will generate its own test query,
#therefore any preferredTestQuery set will be ignored. You should not work with the named table after c3p0 creates it;
#it should be strictly for c3p0's use in testing your Connection.
#(If you define your own ConnectionTester,

#If library, the contextClassLoader will be the class that loaded c3p0 classes.
#If none, no contextClassLoader will be set (the property will be null),
#which in practice means the system ClassLoader will be used.
#The default setting of caller is sometimes a problem when client applications will be hot redeployed by an app-server.
#When c3p0's Threads hold a reference to a contextClassLoader from the first client that hits them,

#Every c3p0 pooled data source is given a dataSourceName, which serves two purposes.
#It helps users find DataSources via C3P0Registry, and it is included in the name of JMX mBeans
#in order to help track and distinguish between multiple c3p0 DataSources even across application or JVM restarts.
#dataSourceName defaults to the pool's configuration name, if a named config was used,
#or else to an "identity token" (an opaque, guaranteed unique String associated with every c3p0 DataSource).
#You may update this property to any name you find convenient.
#dataSourceName is not guaranteed to be unique — for example,

#If true, and if unreturnedConnectionTimeout is set to a positive value, then the pool will capture the stack trace
#(via an Exception) of all Connection checkouts,
#and the stack traces will be printed when unreturned checked-out Connections timeout.
#This is intended to debug applications with Connection leaks,
#that is applications that occasionally fail to return Connections, leading to pool growth,

#Strongly disrecommended.
#Setting this to true may lead to subtle and bizarre bugs.
#This is a terrible setting, leave it alone unless absolutely necessary.
#It is here to workaround broken databases / JDBC drivers that do not properly support transactions,
#but that allow Connections' autoCommit flags to go to false regardless.
#If you are using a database that supports transactions "partially"
#(this is oxymoronic, as the whole point of transactions is to perform operations reliably and completely,
#but nonetheless such databases are out there),
#if you feel comfortable ignoring the fact that Connections with autoCommit == false may be in the middle of
#transactions and may hold locks and other resources, you may turn off c3p0's wise default behavior,
#which is to protect itself, as well as the usability and consistency of the database,
#by either rolling back (default) or committing (see c3p0.autoCommitOnClose above) unresolved transactions.
#This should only be set to true when you are sure you are using a database that allows Connections'
#autoCommit flag to go to false, but offers no other meaningful support of transactions.
#Otherwise setting this to true is just a bad idea.
#forceIgnoreUnresolvedTransactions=false

#Setting this to true forces Connections to be checked-in synchronously,
#which under some circumstances may improve performance.
#Ordinarily Connections are checked-in asynchronously so that clients avoid any overhead of testing
#or custom check-in logic. However, asynchronous check-in contributes to thread pool congestion,
#and very busy pools might find clients delayed waiting for check-ins to complete.
#Expanding numHelperThreads can help manage Thread pool congestion,
#but memory footprint and switching costs put limits on practical thread pool size.
#To reduce thread pool load, you can set forceSynchronousCheckins to true.
#Synchronous check-ins are likely to improve overall performance when testConnectionOnCheckin is set to false
#and no slow work is performed in a ConnectionCustomizer's onCheckIn(...) method.
#If Connections are tested or other slow work is performed on check-in,
#then this setting will cause clients to experience the overhead of that work on Connection.close(),
#which you must trade-off against any improvements in pool performance.
forceSynchronousCheckins=false

#Setting the parameter driverClass causes that class to preload and register with java.sql.DriverManager.
#However, it does not on its own ensure that the driver used will be an instance of driverClass,
#as DriverManager may (in unusual cases) know of other driver classes which can handle the specified jdbcUrl.
#Setting this parameter to true causes c3p0 to ignore DriverManager and simply instantiate driverClass directly.

#The JDBC URL of the database from which Connections can and should be acquired.
#Should resolve via java.sql.DriverManager to an appropriate JDBC Driver
#(which you can ensure will be loaded and available by setting driverClass),
#or if you wish to specify which driver to use directly (and avoid DriverManager resolution),
#you may specify driverClass in combination with forceUseNamedDriverClass.
#Unless you are supplying your own unpooled DataSource, a must always be provided and appropriate for the JDBC driver,

#Seconds before c3p0's thread pool will try to interrupt an apparently hung task.
#Rarely useful. Many of c3p0's functions are not performed by client threads,
#but asynchronously by an internal thread pool. c3p0's asynchrony enhances client performance directly,
#and minimizes the length of time that critical locks are held by ensuring that slow jdbc operations are performed
#in non-lock-holding threads. If, however, some of these tasks "hang",
#that is they neither succeed nor fail with an Exception for a prolonged period of time,
#c3p0's thread pool can become exhausted and administrative tasks backed up.
#If the tasks are simply slow, the best way to resolve the problem is to increase the number of threads,
#via numHelperThreads. But if tasks sometimes hang indefinitely,
#you can use this parameter to force a call to the task thread's interrupt() method if a task exceeds a set time limit.
#[c3p0 will eventually recover from hung tasks anyway by signalling an "APPARENT DEADLOCK"
#(you'll see it as a warning in the logs), replacing the thread pool task threads, and
#interrupt()ing the original threads. But letting the pool go into APPARENT DEADLOCK and then recover means that
#for some periods, c3p0's performance will be impaired. So if you're seeing these messages,
#increasing numHelperThreads and setting maxAdministrativeTaskTime might help.
#maxAdministrativeTaskTime should be large enough that any reasonable attempt to acquire a Connection from the database,
#to test a Connection, or to destroy a Connection, would be expected to succeed or fail within the time set.
#Zero (the default) means tasks are never interrupted, which is the best and safest policy under most circumstances.
#If tasks are just slow, allocate more threads. If tasks are hanging forever, try to figure out why,
#and maybe setting maxAdministrativeTaskTime can help in the meantime.
maxAdministrativeTaskTime=0

#Seconds, effectively a time to live.
#A Connection older than maxConnectionAge will be destroyed and purged from the pool.

#Number of seconds that Connections in excess of minPoolSize should be permitted to remain idle in the pool
#before being culled. Intended for applications that wish to aggressively minimize the number of open Connections,
#shrinking the pool back towards minPoolSize if, following a spike, the load level diminishes and Connections
#acquired are no longer needed. If maxIdleTime is set, maxIdleTimeExcessConnections should be smaller if

#but no global limit will be enforced, only the per-connection maximum.
#maxStatements controls the total number of Statements cached, for all Connections.
#If set, it should be a fairly large number, as each pooled Connection requires its own,
#distinct flock of cached statements.
#As a guide, consider how many distinct PreparedStatements are used frequently in your application,

#If set, maxStatementsPerConnection should be set to about the number distinct PreparedStatements
#that are used frequently in your application, plus two or three extra so infrequently statements don't force
